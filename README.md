The purpose of this analysis is to create a data model that predicts the cridit risk of a potential borrower from peer to peer vendor services, and to evaluate the accuracy of this model. 

2
Balanced Accuracy Score: 95.20% --> the meaning of the balanced accuracy score is that when taking into account the sensitivity and specificity of the model, the lananced prediction accuracy is 95.2%
Precision Score: 92% -->  the meaning of this is that 92% of the predicted positives were correct
Recall Score: 95% --> this means that the model was 95% precise in measuring true positive values our of all positive predictions made   the meaning of this is that the model is 95% precise in measuring the true positive values of all positive predictions made

I would recommend using this model to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers, because it has over 95% accuracy in predicting the outcome of the repayment of the initial loan. That accuracy range could be easily molded into a business risk profile to ensure sufficient capital flow for the lenders to remain in business/make a profit.

This model is recommended to use the crdit wirthiness of a potential borower, because the accuracy is 95% correct in predicting the outcome of the intitial loan repayment.
